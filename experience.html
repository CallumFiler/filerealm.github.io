									<h2 id="content">Past Work</h2>
									<h4>First and Second Internships at SaxaVord UK Spaceport</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Saxa_headshot.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I completed two internships at SaxaVord UK Spaceport, the UK’s first operational vertical launch site. During my first placement (Sept–Nov 2024), I took part in key operational tasks, including maintaining Safety Exclusion Zones for rocket engine tests, 
										 and collaborating with the team to keep daily operations running smoothly.
										 <br><br>
										 I returned for a second internship (June–July 2025) to build on that experience, further developing my technical and operational skills in a fast-paced aerospace environment. Both placements were an incredible opportunity to get hands-on experience 
										 in spaceport operations and contribute directly to the development of the site.
									<br><br><br>

									<h4>Alan Marshall Mathematics Tutor</h4>
									<p><span>As a Mathematics Tutor with Alan Marshall Mathematics Tutors, I work with students across National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher levels, helping them build confidence and a solid understanding of key concepts. 
										I also help with the running of the Higher Applications of Mathematics course. It’s really rewarding to see students grasp new ideas and enjoy learning maths.</span></p>

									<h4>Hydrogen Fuel Racing COO</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/HFR.png" alt="" /></span>As Chief Operating Officer of the University of Glasgow Hydrogen Fuel Racing Society, I helped grow the team and make sure everything ran smoothly. I took part in recruitment, 
										giving talks to students and welcoming new members, as we developed a hydrogen-powered race vehicle for the Eco-Shell Marathon.
										<br><br>
										I also worked on the society’s branding and outreach, helping connect with sponsors and build the team’s presence. It was a really rewarding experience seeing the society come together and grow.</p>									
									<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

									<h4>Glasgow University OirthirSAT Software Engineer</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/OirthirSAT_Headshot.JPG" alt="" /></span>During my time at University I was a Software Engineer on the OirthirSAT project, a nanosatellite project that won a national competition run by the UK Space Agency. I worked on software development for Earth observation and data analysis. 
										I helped to create a UNET-based machine learning algorithm to map images of the UK coastline for measuring sea level changes related to climate change. <br><br>I also helped to convert Marching Squares, FMask, and UNET algorithms into C++, preparing them for integration with the satellite’s onboard systems. '
										Alongside this, I contributed to the Critical Design Review (CDR) with UKSpace, alongside this I built a fully functional project website in HTML, JS and CSS. Being part of this award-winning project was an incredible experience that combined software engineering, innovation, and climate research.</p>
									<br><br><br><br>

									<h4>Glasgow University Avionics Member and Business and Operations Member</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/GUR_headshot.PNG" alt="" /></span>As part of GU Rocketry, I worked within both the Avionics and Business & Operations teams, contributing to a range of technical and creative projects. 
										On the avionics side, I helped develop SOLARA, an environmental avionics board designed to collect barometric, humidity, and temperature data during flight. <br><br>I helped with component selection and schematic design in KiCAD, ensuring reliable 
										performance in high-altitude conditions. Being part of this project was a great experience.</p>
									<br><br><br><br>
									<h4>NHS Healthcare Support Worker</h4>
									<p>In my second year of university, I worked as a Healthcare Support Worker with the NHS. It was a really meaningful job that gave me a genuine understanding of what it means to care for people. 
										I supported vulnerable patients across the Glasgow and Clyde area, often during 12-hour shifts, and always tried to make their day a little easier. It was challenging at times, but incredibly rewarding.</p>

									<h4>The Red Sock Laundrette and Cleaning Services Cleaner</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/RSL-Vehicle.jpg" alt="" /></span>My first job was as a Cleaner at <bold>The Red Sock Laundrette</bold>, where I helped to provide 
									cleaning services across the Highlands — from local care homes and GP practices to hotels and holiday cottages. It was a busy 
									and hands-on role that taught me the importance of reliability, teamwork, and good communication with customers. 
									<br><br> 
									As I gained more experience, 
									I also took on responsibility for managing invoices which gave me insight into the business and software side of operations. 
									I really enjoyed working closely with both clients and colleagues to make sure every job was done to a high standard and everyone left satisfied.</p>										
									<br><br><br>
									<h4>Army Cadet </h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ACF.jpg" alt="" style="width: 200px; height: auto;"/></span>From 2013 to 2019, I was part of the Army Cadet Force, where I worked my way up to Cadet Sergeant. 
										Over the years, I took part in training weekends, summer camps, and events — experiences that were both challenging and a lot of fun.
										Being a cadet gave me the chance to learn hands-on skills like fieldcraft, navigation, and first aid, while also developing leadership and teamwork abilities. 
										<br><br>
										As a Cadet Sergeant, I enjoyed helping to guide younger cadets and seeing them grow in confidence. It was a big part of my teenage years and taught me lessons about responsibility, communication, 
										and perseverance that I still carry with me today.
